**Process & Design**

This section discusses a process that you can use when you are creating a new website.

It looks at who might be visiting your site and how to ensure 
the pages feature the information those visitors need. It also 
covers some key aspects of design theory to help you create 
professional looking sites. In this chapter, we will look at:

● How to understand the audience your site may attract and 
what information they will expect to find on it

● How to organize information so that visitors can find what 
they are looking for

● Design theory for presenting information in a way that 
helps visitors achieve their goals

● Design tips to help you create more attractive and 
professional sites


**Who is the Site For?**
Every website should be designed for the  target audience—not just for yourself or the site owner. It is therefore very important to understand who your target audience is.

It can be helpful to ask some questions about the people you would expect to be interested in the subject of your site.
If you ask a client who a site is for, it is not uncommon for them to answer "the entire world."

Realistically, it is unlikely to berelevant to everyone. If your site sells light bulbs, even though most people using a computer 
probably use light bulbs, they are not likely to order them from someone in a different country.

Even if the site has a wide appeal, you can still think about the demographics of a sample of the target audience.

 **Target Audience: individuals**
● What is the age range of your target audience?
● Will your site appeal to more women or men? What is the mix?
● Which country do your visitors live in?
● Do they live in urban or rural areas?
● What is the average income of visitors?
● What level of education do they have?
● What is their marital or family status?
● What is their occupation?
● How many hours do they work per week?
● How often do they use the web?
● What kind of device do they use to access the web?

**Target Audience: Companies**
● What is the size of the company or relevant department?
● What is the position of people in the company who visit your site?
● Will visitors be using the site for themselves or for someone else?
● How large is the budget they control?

**Visual hierarchy**

Most web users do not read entire pages. Rather, they skim to find information. You can use contrast to create a visual hierarchy that gets across your key message and helps users find what they are looking for.

**SIZE**
Larger elements will grab users' attention first. For this reason it is a good idea to make headings and key points relatively large.

**COLOR**
Foreground and background color can draw attention to key messages. Brighter sections tend to draw users' attention first.

**Style**
An element may be the same size and color as surrounding content but have a different style applied to it to make it stand out.

**Visual hierarchy** refers to the order in which your eyes perceive what they see. It is created by adding visual contrast between the items being displayed. Items with higher contrast are recognized and processed first.

**Images**
Images create a high visual contrast and often attract the eye first. They can be used to draw attention to a specific message within the page. In some cases, the right image can succinctly reveal more than an entire page of text.

The effect of a well-designed visual hierarchy is largely subliminal. Achieving a good hierarchy requires balance; if nothing stands out a site can be rather uninteresting, and if too many aspects are competing for your attention it can be hard to find the key messages. This example has a clear hierarchy which addresses the needs of visitors to the site.

**Summary**
PROCESS & Design

- It's important to understand who your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return.

 - Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.

- Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.

- Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.

- You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style. 
 

 - You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present.
