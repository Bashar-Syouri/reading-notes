## WHAT IS A FUNCTION?


**Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).**






**Declaring functions**

To create a Function, you give it a name and then write the statements needed to achieve its task inside the curly braces.
This is known as a **Function declaration**

You declare a function using the function keyword.

You give the function a name (somettimes calles in identifier) followed by parentheses.

The statements that perform the task sit in a code block. (they are inside curly braces.)

**Calling Function**

Having declared the function, you can thenn execute all of the statements between its curly braves with just one line of code.
This is known as **calling the function.**

To run the code in the function, you use the function name folloed by parentheses.

In programmer-speak, you would say that this code calls a function.

You can call the same function as many times as you want within the same JavaScript file.
