### Operators in JavaScript Programming


#### **JavaScript operators** are *symbols* which are used to assign values, compare values, perform arithmetic operations, and more.

- The variables (operations) are called **operands**.
- The operation (to be performed between the two operands) is defined by an **operator**.


   JavaScript supports the following types of operators.

- **Arithmetic Operators**
- **Comparison Operators**
- **Logical (or Relational) Operators**
- **Assignment Operators**
- **Conditional (or ternary) Operators**
- **String Operators**
- **Type Operators**
- **Bitwise Operators**



### JavaScript Comparison Operators 

**Comparison** and Logical operators are used to test for *true* or *false*.

**Example:-**

- if (age < 18) text = "Too young";
var voteable = (age < 18) ? "Too young":"Old enough"; // ternary operator

  ' if -else example
age = Number(age);
if (isNaN(age)) {
       voteable = "Input is not a number";
} else {
      voteable = (age < 18) ? "Too young" : "Old enough";
} '




### JavaScript Logical (or Relational) Operators 

Comparison and **Logical** operators are used to test for *true* or *false*.   Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values.
