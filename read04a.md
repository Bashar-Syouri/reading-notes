**HOW HTML, CSS, & JAVASCRIPT FIT TOGETHER**

#### Before diving into the JavaScript language, you need to know how it will fit together with the HTML and CSS in your web pages. ####

- Web developers usually talk about three languages that are used to create web pages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

#### CONTENT LAYER . html files ####

This is where the content of the page lives. The HTML gives the page structure and adds semantics. 

- Where possible,  aim to keep the three languages in separate files, with the HTML page linking to CSS and JavaScript files.

#### PRESENTATION LAYER . css files ####

The CSS enhances the HTML page with rules that state how the HTML content is presented (backgrounds, borders, box dimensions, colors,fonts, etc.).


- Each language forms a separate layer with a different purpose. 
Each layer, from left to right. builds on the previous one.

#### BEHAVIOR LAYER .js files ####

This is where we can change how the page behaves, adding interactivity. We will aim to keep as much of our JavaScript as possible in separate files.
