##### Growth Mindset

The concept of a growth mindset is a popular topic lately, and I sometimes say to myself “Self, you need to embrace the growth mindset. The growth mindset is cool.”


### What is a growth mindset?
 A growth mindset it is mean that one’s fundamental abilities can be developed through perseverance and effort; intelligence and talent are simply good starting points.

By contrast, in a fixed mindset, intelligence and talent are seen as fixed traits, suggesting that success comes from these inherent qualities alone, without the need for further development or effort

Here’s a simple illustration highlighting the differences between a fixed and a growth mindset:
